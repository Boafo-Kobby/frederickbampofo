This section will examine ethical considerations relevant to the field of information technology,
including a focused case study of an ethical dilemma. 
Emphasis will be placed on responsibility, accountability, 
and adherence to professional and moral standards.

During a controlled laboratory environment, I was granted full administrative access in order to complete a troubleshooting task. 
While performing my duties, I became aware that my level of access allowed me to view user data that was not required for the specific task I had been assigned. 
Although no other individuals were physically present, this situation created an ethical dilemma involving the potential misuse of privileged access.

The individuals indirectly involved included myself as the administrator and the end users whose data could have been accessed without their knowledge.
The core ethical issues in this scenario were the temptation to access unnecessary information, the violation of user privacy, 
and the breach of trust that users place in technology professionals. Administrative privileges carry significant responsibility, 
and misuse whether intentional or accidental can undermine confidence in information systems.

In response to this dilemma, I consciously limited my actions strictly to what was required to complete the troubleshooting task. 
I followed the principle of least privilege by avoiding access to any data unrelated to my objective. 
Additionally, I documented my actions clearly to ensure transparency and accountability. 
This approach aligned with professional standards of ethical conduct in information technology, particularly those related to data protection and confidentiality.

My faith played a significant role in guiding my ethical decision-making. 
Gospel principles emphasize integrity, stewardship, and accountability, especially when no one is watching. 
The teaching “For Times of Trouble” by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reinforces the importance of choosing what is right even in private moments. 
By respecting user privacy and exercising self-restraint, 
I demonstrated that ethical behavior is not dependent on supervision but on character. This experience strengthened my commitment to ethical professionalism and responsible stewardship in the technology field.
